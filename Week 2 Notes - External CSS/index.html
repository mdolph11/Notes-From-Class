<h1>Anime & Why You Should Watch It!</h1>

<h3>Introduction To Anime:</h3>
<p>For those aren't to familiar with anime. The definition of 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=definiton+of+anime&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS938US938&oq=definiton+of+anime&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIOCAEQABgKGEYY-QEYgAQyCQgCEAAYChiABDIJCAMQABgKGIAEMgkIBBAAGAoYgAQyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgGEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyCggHEAAYogQYiQXSAQgzODU2ajBqOagCALACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">anime</a> 
    according to Google, "Is a style of Japanese film and television animation, typically aimed at adults as well as children."In shorter words, it's Japanese cartoons. 
    I watched a few animes as a kid/teen growing up like, Yu-Gi-Oh, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and a few Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z episodes. But I really got into anime when I was 
    around 20-21 years old, now about to turn 27. Anime can be really cool if you open your mind up to it. For me I found a liking to anime because of 2 mains reasons, The emotions 
    the shows make you feel, and the animation effects in the shows and fight scenes.
